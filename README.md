# Number-Recognition-With-Neural-Networks

This project is build around the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen:

http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

The goal of this project is to create a deep learining neural network capable of number recognition. The code is written in C# under .NET Framework 4.6.1.

Demo project for showing the use of:

- Design patterns
- SOLID design principles
- Unit testing (in progress)
