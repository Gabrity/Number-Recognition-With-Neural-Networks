# Number-Recognition-With-Neural-Networks

This project is build around the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen:

http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

The goal of this project is to create a deep learining neural network capable of number recognition, the "Hello world!" of deep learning algorithms. There are no external libraries used, everything is built from scratch. The code is written in C# under .NET Framework 4.6.1.

This project serves as a demo for showing the use of:

- Design patterns
- SOLID design principles
- Unit testing (in progress)
