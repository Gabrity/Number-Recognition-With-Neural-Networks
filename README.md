# Number-Recognition-With-Neural-Networks

This project is build around the book Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen:

http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

The goal of this project is to create a deep learining neural network capable of number recognition, the "Hello world!" of deep learning algorithms.

The implementation is done with scikit-learn in python
